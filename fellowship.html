                    Ideated at the Second Annual Congressional Hackathon and seeded by George Washington University and our founders, Represently is a software startup dedicated to improving lawmaker-citizen relationships. Our company is founded on the belief that an influx of constituent communication should be a lawmaker’s greatest asset, not a hassle. Thus, we’re building the world’s first two-sided platform dedicated to lawmaker-constituent relationships.

                <center><h2>Fellowship Program</h2></center>
                <p>Represently is hiring summer fellows to join our determined team. Fellows will join for ten weeks and have housing provided in Washington, DC. In addition, Represently has partnered with the National Council on Entrepreneurial Tech Transfer (NCET2) to provide weekly programming where Fellows will be exposed to the DC startup ecosystem, including meetings with angel investors and venture capitalists and talks with prominent area entrepreneurs. Fellows are intended to have the opportunity to extend their commitment to beyond the summer. <br><br>We seek Software Development Fellows for both frontend and backend development. Experience in Django or Vue.js are preferred but not required. We're also looking for Strategist Fellows to identify growth opportunities, implement plans to capture them, and use client feedback to make our product be as impactful as possible.</p>

                                You’ll work closely with our team to immediately write production-ready code. Because of our early stage, you will have tremendous opportunity to shape the product’s direction, tangibly improving the ability for lawmakers to hear their constituents’ concerns.

                                In addition, we place a strong emphasis on education, particularly for Fellows. Expect weekly seminars on systems, architecture, machine learning, and more.

                                A successful Strategist Fellow applies their generalist skillset, whether technical or otherwise, to their passion for civic tech. Expect the opportunity to define your own role, which may include designing and implementing outreach strategies, defining features, and educating users. You will identify growth opportunities and implement the analytical plan to capture them. Moreover, you are the vital connection between growing clients and informing our development team.

                                Strategist Fellows are in prime position to capitalize on our partnership with the National Council on Entrepreneurial Tech Transfer. You will identify leads for the Represently team while professionally growing through regular seminars with angels and venture capitalists, onsite visits to fellow DC-area ventures, and influencers in the political space.

                                You’ll work closely with our team to immediately write production-ready code. Because of our early stage, you will have tremendous opportunity to shape the product’s direction, tangibly improving the ability for lawmakers to hear their constituents’ concerns.

                                In addition, we place a strong emphasis on education, particularly for Fellows. Expect weekly seminars on systems, architecture, machine learning, and more. Investing in you is a company staple: even with three hours dedicated to pure learning, a Fellow only needs to become seven percent more efficient in a hypothetical 50-hour work week to exceed otherwise anticipated output.

                                A successful Strategist Fellow applies their generalist skillset, whether technical or otherwise, to their passion for civic tech. Expect the opportunity to define your own role, which may include designing and implementing outreach strategies, defining features, and educating users. You will identify growth opportunities and implement the analytical plan to capture them. Moreover, you are the vital connection between growing clients and informing our development team.

                                Strategist Fellows are in prime position to capitalize on our partnership with the National Council on Entrepreneurial Tech Transfer. You will identify leads for the Represently team while professionally growing through regular seminars with angels and venture capitalists, onsite visits to fellow DC-area ventures, and influencers in the political space.
